# Password Generator

## Description

This webpage is created to generate random passwords based on criteria that users selected. Users can select the length of the password from 8 - 128, and character types to include in it (lowercase, uppercase, number, special characters). The application will show an error message when the number for the length is not valid or at least one of the character types are not selected.


## Usage
Click the 'Generate Password' button to generate a random password.  
If you want to see the history of the values inserted, right-click on the page to see 'Inspect' and click 'Console'.
